# Clojure-Grep - simplistic grep written in Clojure for demo purposes

## Overview

This is a very simple command line program that'a intended to demonstrate something useful. Use in production is not recommended :-)

It shows a few basic aspects of programming in Clojure:

* How to integrate Clojure with Java to be able to run a program from the command line
* Simple file I/O
* How to use some of the sequence functions
* Some (somewhat useless) parallelization

Do whatever you like with it, this is just a bit of example code.
